YARTY
=====

Yare and Astounding Regression Tester: YARTY

YARTY is similar to other CL regression test libraries. The main
design points particular to YARTY are as follows. First, the returned
value from testing is immediately compatible with
CL-TEST-GRID. Second, there is only one test predicate \-\- TEST-AND
\-\- and it only tests whether values are truthy. For other
predicates, e.g. EQUAL, the YARTY way is to include the EQUAL call
within a TEST-AND. Third, automatic triggering of the test suite on
filesystem changes is included via TEST-ON-CHANGE.

The latter feature is still experimental.

Glossary
========

For Writing Tests
-----------------

DEFTEST:            Define a function that will be called during run-tests. 
DEFTEST/AND:        Like DEFTEST but wraps its body in a test-and.
TEST-AND:           Test that each form returns truthy.
SIGNALS-A:          Returns true if body signals the condition.

For Running Tests
-----------------

RUN-TESTS:          Runs all the tests defined by deftest. 
TEST-ON-CHANGE:     Start a background thread which runs tests when location is modified.
*HANDLE-ERRORS*:    t: handle errors in tests; nil: decline to handle. Default is t.

For Managing Tests
------------------

CLEAR-TESTS:        Clear the tests for the given package, default to *package*.
