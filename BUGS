1. When LS tests were autorunning and autorun and we used
   test-on-change in SDB, the LS test suit seemed to trigger two or
   three dozen times in a row.
-- Went away with queue driven redesign

2. Is handler aborting the rest of the clauses to a test and on error
   instead of running them?
-- can't reproduce

3. Argument values aren't shown in any way.
-- added printing of function arguments for failed tests

4. No option to drop into the debugger. Could expose through a global
   special.
-- added *handle-errors*

5. Need a way to stop test-on-change
-- Fixed; call TEST-ON-CHANGE again to toggle it.

6. Somehow we managed to deadlock sbcl when stress testing
   test-on-change (this may have been related with running
   test-on-change multiple times for the same system and manually
   killing threads)
-- Can't reproduce. Probably eliminated when TEST-ON-CHANGE was
   rewritten.
