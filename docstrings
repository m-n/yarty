YARTY > ASDF System
 Yare and Astounding Regression Tester: YARTY

*handle-errors* > variable
 t: handle in tests; nil: decline to handle. Default is t.

*output* > variable
 The stream testing info is print to.

This defaults to a *standard-output* synonym-stream.

(AUTORUN &key system) > function
 Toggle whether asdf:test-system is automatically run when source is touched.

System should be a string or symbol designating a system name. Autorun
also binds *handle-errors* to t.

Touching files of a test-system will also trigger the tests if the
asdf setup described in YARTY's readme is used.

(CLEAR-TESTS &optional package) > function
 Clear the tests for the given package, default to *package*.

If nil is given as an explicit argument, clear all tests for all
packages.

(DEFTEST name &body body) > macro
 Define a function that will be called during RUN-TESTS.

Insert forms which should return truthy inside an EACH.

(DEFTEST/EACH name &body body) > macro
 Like DEFTEST but wraps its body in an EACH.

(EACH &body forms) > macro
 Test that each form returns truthy.

If any don't, set the current test to failing.

(FRESH-TEST system &key host port lisp) > function
 Test on a fresh CCL or SBCL image. Assumes the userinit loads quicklisp.

(RUN-TESTS &rest packages) > function
 Runs all the tests defined by DEFTEST in the given packages.

Returns output suitable for use by cl-test-grid.

(SIGNALS-A condition &body body) > macro
 Returns true if body signals the condition.

(TEST-SYSTEM system &key quit) > function
 Test the system. Either return the last value of RUN-TESTS or quit the image.

Internally calls ASDF:TEST-SYSTEM. If quit is nil, then this records
the result of any calls to RUN-TESTS made during ASDF:TEST-SYSTEM and
returns the last one.

If QUIT is true then it exits the image after testing. In this case
the exit code of the process indicates the status of the tests.

        Exit Code    Status
        0            Tests Succeeded
        1            Tests Failed
        125          Could Not Test
